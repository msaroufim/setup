Tools I liked, I finally caved and listened to @drisspg who kept asking me to improve my setup ðŸ‘´

### Must have
* ripgrep (rg): ripgrep pattern directory
* fzf (f): fuzzy filename finder, also cntrl+r will search commands
* oh my zsh: looks pretty. combo it with zsh-snap and zsh autocomplete
* autojump (j): fuzzy jump
* gh: github cli
* btop
* tmux replacement: https://zellij.dev/ (amazing)
* lazyvim

### Nice to have
* duf (du): like du but pretty
* neofetch (info): get system info quickly (fastfetch is now cooler)
* bpython: pretty python shell with autocomplete
* sshx: collaborative programming but more reliable and prettier than tmate
