Tools I liked, I finally caved and listened to @drisspg who kept asking me to improve my setup 👴

### Must have
* ripgrep (rg): ripgrep pattern directory
* fzf (f): fuzzy filename finder, also cntrl+r will search commands
* oh my zsh: looks pretty. combo it with zsh-snap and zsh autocomplete
* autojump (j): fuzzy jump
* gh: github cli
* sshx: collaborative programming but more reliable and prettier than tmate

### Nice to have
* bat (cat): like cat but pretty
* duf (du): like du but pretty
* exa (ls): not sure I love this yet
* neofetch (info): get system info quickly

Also add some things like infinite history
